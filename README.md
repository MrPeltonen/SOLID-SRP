# Upskilling: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) Exercise

Welcome to the hands-on exercise for learning the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - the first principle of SOLID design principles. This repository contains a practical Python example that violates SRP, along with comprehensive unit tests to help you understand and practice refactoring code to follow SRP.

**‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Duration: 1 hour**

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:
- ‚úÖ Understand what SRP means and why it matters
- ‚úÖ Identify multiple responsibilities in a single class
- ‚úÖ Refactor code to follow SRP principles
- ‚úÖ See the immediate benefits of cleaner, more modular code

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have:

### Required Software
- **Git** - For cloning the repository
- **Python 3.9 or higher** - The programming language for this exercise
- **Code Editor** - We recommend VS Code, but any editor works
- **Terminal/Command Prompt** - For running commands

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of classes and object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with running Python scripts and tests


## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Download the Code

**Where to work:** You can use VS Code's built-in terminal (recommended) or your system's terminal/command prompt.

**To open VS Code's terminal:**
- In VS Code: `Terminal` ‚Üí `New Terminal` (or press `` Ctrl+` `` / `` Cmd+` ``)

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:MrPeltonen/SOLID-SRP.git
cd SOLID-SRP
```

**New to Git?** 
- Git cloning downloads a copy of the code to your computer
- If you don't have Git installed, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
- For a beginner's guide to Git: [Git Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

### Step 2: Open the Project in VS Code

1. Open VS Code
2. Click `File` ‚Üí `Open Folder` 
3. Navigate to and select the `SOLID-SRP` folder you just downloaded
4. Open the integrated terminal: `Terminal` ‚Üí `New Terminal` (or press `` Ctrl+` `` / `` Cmd+` ``)

### Step 3: Set Up Python Environment

**Important:** All the following commands should be run in VS Code's integrated terminal (or your system terminal if you prefer).

#### For macOS Users:

1. **Check if Python 3.9+ is installed:**
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
   If Python 3.9+ is not installed, install it using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   # First install Homebrew if you don't have it
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   # Then install Python
   brew install python@3.9
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (in VS Code terminal):**
   ```bash
   # This creates a folder called 'venv' in your project directory
   python3 -m venv venv
   # This activates the virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   **You'll know it worked when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.**

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### For Windows Users:

1. **Install Python 3.9+:**
   - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
   - Restart VS Code after installation
   - Verify installation in VS Code's terminal:
     ```cmd
     python --version
     ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (in VS Code terminal):**
   ```cmd
   # This creates a folder called 'venv' in your project directory
   python -m venv venv
   # This activates the virtual environment
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   **You'll know it worked when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.**

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Your Setup

**Run this command in VS Code's terminal (with your virtual environment activated):**

```bash
# Run the unit tests
python -m pytest test_user_manager.py -v
```

**Expected Results:** You should see 16 tests pass and 12 tests fail. The failing tests are for the refactored implementation (which you'll complete during the exercise). The passing tests are for the original implementation, confirming your setup works correctly.

If you see this mix of passing and failing tests, you're ready to start! üéâ

## üìö Understanding the Exercise

### The Problem: SRP Violations

This UserManager class has multiple responsibilities:
1. User data management (CRUD operations)
2. Email validation

This violates SRP because the class has multiple reasons to change:
- Changes in user data structure
- Changes in email validation rules

### Why This Is a Problem

- **Hard to maintain** - Changes to one responsibility might break others
- **Difficult to test** - Testing one feature requires setting up all features
- **Poor reusability** - Can't reuse validation logic without the entire class
- **Violates separation of concerns** - Multiple reasons for the class to change

### The Solution: Apply SRP

Your task is to refactor this code into multiple classes, each with a single responsibility:

- `User` - Represents user data
- `UserRepository` - Handles user data storage/retrieval
- `EmailValidator` - Validates email formats
- `UserService` - Orchestrates user operations

**Note:** A partial template solution is available in `refactored_partial.py` to help guide your refactoring. This template provides the class structure and method signatures, but you'll need to complete the implementation marked with TODO comments.

## üß™ Running Tests

**Where to run:** All test commands should be executed in VS Code's integrated terminal with your virtual environment activated (you should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt).

The repository includes comprehensive unit tests that work both before and after refactoring. The test file (`test_user_manager.py`) is designed to automatically test both the original `UserManager` class and the refactored solution when available.

**Important:** Until you complete the implementation in `refactored_partial.py`, some tests will fail for the refactored version. This is expected and part of the exercise - your goal is to make all tests pass for both implementations.

### Using pytest (recommended)

**In VS Code's terminal (with venv activated):**

```bash
# Run all tests with verbose output
python -m pytest test_user_manager.py -v

# Run tests with coverage report
python -m pytest test_user_manager.py --cov=user_manager --cov-report=html

# Run specific test
python -m pytest test_user_manager.py::TestUserManager::test_create_user_success -v
```

**Alternative: Using VS Code's Test Explorer**
1. Install the "Python Test Explorer" extension in VS Code
2. Open the test file (`test_user_manager.py`) in VS Code
3. Click the "Run Tests" button that appears above test functions
4. View results in VS Code's Test Explorer panel

### How the Tests Work

The tests use a smart fixture that automatically detects and tests both implementations:
- **Original Implementation**: Tests the `UserManager` class from `user_manager.py`
- **Refactored Implementation**: Tests the refactored solution from `refactored_partial.py` (when available)

This ensures that both versions maintain identical functionality!

### Test Categories

The tests cover:

- ‚úÖ User creation with valid/invalid data
- ‚úÖ User retrieval and updates
- ‚úÖ User deletion
- ‚úÖ Email validation patterns
- ‚úÖ Logging functionality
- ‚úÖ Complete workflow integration

### Understanding Test Failures

When you first run the tests with the incomplete `refactored_partial.py`, you'll see failures like:
- `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` - Methods returning `None` instead of expected data
- `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'ValueError'>` - Validation logic not implemented
- `assert 0 > 0` - Empty logs because logging isn't implemented

This is expected! As you implement each TODO section, more tests will pass.

## üéØ Exercise Instructions

**Important:** All Python commands in this exercise should be run in VS Code's integrated terminal with your virtual environment activated (you should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt).

### Phase 1: Analyze the Current Code (15 minutes)

1. **Read through `user_manager.py`** - Open the file in VS Code to identify all the different responsibilities
2. **Run the code** - In VS Code's terminal, run: `python user_manager.py`
3. **Run the tests** - In VS Code's terminal, run: `python -m pytest test_user_manager.py -v`
4. **List the violations** - Write down each responsibility you identify

### Phase 2: Plan Your Refactoring (10 minutes)

1. **Design new classes** - Decide what classes you'll create
2. **Define interfaces** - Think about how classes will interact
3. **Plan migration** - Decide the order of refactoring

### Phase 3: Refactor the Code (45 minutes)

1. **Complete the template** - Open `refactored_partial.py` in VS Code as your starting point
2. **Implement TODO sections** - Fill in the missing functionality marked with TODO comments
3. **Run tests frequently** - After each implementation, run `python -m pytest test_user_manager.py -v` in VS Code's terminal
4. **Refine and improve** - Clean up code and improve design

**Note**: The template in `refactored_partial.py` provides the class structure and method signatures to help guide your refactoring, but you'll need to complete the implementation marked with TODO comments.

**Recommended Implementation Order:**
1. Start with `User.to_dict()` method (simplest)
2. Implement `EmailValidator.is_valid()` 
3. Complete `Logger.log()` method
4. Implement `UserRepository` methods (`save`, `find_by_username`, `delete`)
5. Complete `User.update()` method
6. Finally, implement `UserService` methods (`create_user`, `get_user`, `update_user`)

### Phase 4: Reflection (15 minutes)

1. **Compare before/after** - What improved?
2. **Run tests again** - Verify everything still works
3. **Discuss benefits** - What's easier now?

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start small** - Refactor one responsibility at a time
2. **Run tests often** - After each change, verify tests still pass
3. **Keep the interface** - Don't change how external code uses your classes
4. **Use dependency injection** - Make classes depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
5. **Think about testability** - Each class should be easy to test in isolation

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Virtual environment not activated?**
- You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your VS Code terminal prompt
- If not, run the activation command again:
  - **macOS:** `source venv/bin/activate`
  - **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`
- If activation fails, make sure you created the virtual environment first

**"Command not found" or "python not recognized"?**
- **macOS:** Try using `python3` instead of `python`
- **Windows:** Make sure Python was added to PATH during installation
- Restart VS Code after installing Python

**Tests failing after refactoring?**
- Check that you didn't change the public interface
- Ensure all functionality is preserved
- Verify import statements are correct
- Run tests frequently to catch issues early

**Import errors or "Module not found"?**
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated (look for `(venv)` in terminal)
- Ensure you ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that all required files are in the correct locations

**Git clone not working?**
- Make sure Git is installed: download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
- Try the HTTPS clone instead: `git clone https://github.com/MrPeltonen/SOLID-SRP.git`

**Python version issues?**
- Ensure you're using Python 3.9 or higher: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
- Consider using pyenv to manage multiple Python versions

### VS Code Specific Help

**Terminal not opening in VS Code?**
- Use the menu: `Terminal` ‚Üí `New Terminal`
- Or use keyboard shortcut: `` Ctrl+` `` (Windows) / `` Cmd+` `` (Mac)

**Can't see test results clearly?**
- Use the verbose flag: `python -m pytest test_user_manager.py -v`
- Install the Python Test Explorer extension for a graphical interface

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error messages carefully - they often tell you exactly what's wrong
2. Verify your environment setup (virtual environment activated, Python installed)
3. Review the original working code
4. Ask for help during the session!
